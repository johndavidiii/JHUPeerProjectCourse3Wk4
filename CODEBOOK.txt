There are four input data bins
Test Inertial (x,y,z axis)
Test Gyro (x,y,z axis)
Train Inertial (x,y,z axis)
Train Gyro (x,y,z axis)

The names of each column in the data frame for each of the above is 
changed to be reflective of actually what the data is;

the column names are the following;
x-Test-Person-
y-Test-Person-
z-Test-Person-
x-Gyro-Person-
y-Gyro-Person-
z-Gyro-Person-
x-Train-Person-
y-Train-Person-
z-Train-Person-

The rest of the code uses self declaring variables
My data set was very clean to start out with and only required
the na.omit() function.
